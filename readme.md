Coding The Logic
--------
**IMPORTANT: IF YOU WRITE LOGIC, THEN GO BACK AND EDIT THE GUI IN THE GUI BUILDER AND SAVE IT, THE LOGIC WILL BE OVERWRITTEN. (An attemped fix for this is in the works)**

**For this section we will be working with a Project titled Demo**

**This Section is likely the most important section in the entire document.**
When you create a project with the GuiBuilder you probably think "Neat, I Got this cool gui built! How do I actually make it functional?" This section will give an overview of how to actually insert the logic into your newly built GUI and some recommendations for getting everything to work.
